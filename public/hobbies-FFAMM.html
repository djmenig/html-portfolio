<h1>F. F. A. M. M.</h1>

<p>This page will evolve as time goes on. For now, this is a placeholder for the FFAMM club!</p>

<p>All my projects and everything I'm interested in can be summed up into the acronym for Family, Fitness, Animals, Machines, and Music.</p>

<h2>My FFAMM</h2>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Family</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I am a family man first and foremost</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Fitness</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I try to stay fit, and the spirit of martial arts has been instilled into me since I was a child</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Animals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I love animals! However, I am a dog person. Currently, we have a Long hair German Shepherd named Ragnar.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Machines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I have always been a tinkerer. From my family's first computer (C64) to anything else like my Harley Davidson motorcycle.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Music</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Music has always been a part of my life. I am a musical artist that started as a drummer, then pickup up instruments as I went along (it's actually how I became more involved in computers back in the 90's). I haven't played in quite some time, but I'm planning to build a place for my studio this year!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Stay tuned! There's much more to come!</h3>
